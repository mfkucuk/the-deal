  sentences:
  - Hey, you there.
  - Huh? Me?
  - Yes, I'm talking to you.
  - Who's talking?
  - Over here.
  - Whoa, you're a talking skull.
  - Yeah, you're gonna end up like me if you're not smart.
  - What do you mean?
  - I was trying to revert my immortality too, just like you.
  - How did you end up like this?
  - Monsters around here are aware of people with immortality.
  - So, they broke my arms and legs.
  - And, I ended up with only my head.
  - You need to be prepared to fight them.
  - Oh, ok. Thanks for the advice old man.
  - Who are you calling old?!
  - Well then, see you around then.
  - Or, I guess not.
