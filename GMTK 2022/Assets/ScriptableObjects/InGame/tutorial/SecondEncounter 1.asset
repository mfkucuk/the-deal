  sentences:
  - Hey wait, are you really gonna leave me here after all I said?
  - We need to cooperate if you want to stay alive.
  - And I get to move around by helping you.
  - Not a bad deal, eh?
  - Hmm...
  - I would be the bad guy if I leave you here now.
  - I guess I will carry you around for now.
  - Sweet! Let's start with the basics.
  - Bones on the top-left of the screen show you,
  - Well, how many bones you have left. If it reaches zero,
  - then you will end up being a skull like me.
  - Bag on the bottom-left allows you to access your items.
  - It seems like you brought some items, that's good.
  - I stored them in magic dice.
  - So that you can use them during fighting.
  - Die on the bottom-right will allow you to move around.
  - Value on the die determines how much you can walk.
  - Number on your head is the remaining moves you have left.
  - And, the number on the top-right tells you how close you are
  - to monsters.
  - If it reaches zero, you will be forced to fight them.
  - That's all I got for now.
  - I'll tell you more as we move on.
  - Thanks! That's a big help.
