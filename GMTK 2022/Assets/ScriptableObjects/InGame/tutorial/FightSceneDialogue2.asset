  sentences:
  - Try throwing your move die to get close to the enemy.
  - By the way, if you're unsure of what the enemy is going to do
  - you can hover over the enemy to see their behaviour.
  - Blue tiles are where the enemy can move to.
  - And, shaking marked tiles are where the enemy can attack.
  - At the right, you can see your bones.
  - Try not to turn into me for both of our sakes.
  - Also, in some fights there will be a time limit.
  - If the timer reaches zero, reinforcements will come
  - and you'll be basically done for.
  - Anyways, get close enough to the monster and try
  - using your attack die.
